# STRATEGY_DESIGN_PATTERN

Strategy design pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern. 
Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple algorithm for a specific task and client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime.
Strategy pattern is also known as Policy Pattern. 
We define multiple algorithms and let client application pass the algorithm to be used as a parameter

This code is an example of Strategy design pattern
